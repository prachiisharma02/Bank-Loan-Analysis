# Bank-Loan-Analysis
SQL and Power BI-based analysis of bank loan data, featuring interactive dashboards and insights

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using SQL for data querying and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. The aim is to provide actionable insights into loan performance, borrower behavior, and financial metrics to aid decision-making.

# Objectives
Analyze and visualize loan data to identify key trends and metrics.
Provide insights into borrower profiles, loan statuses, and repayment performance.
Create interactive dashboards for easy data exploration and understanding.

# Key Features

# Dashboards

# Dashboard 1: Summary

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1) Total Loan Applications (including Month-to-Date and Month-over-Month analysis).
2) Total Funded Amount (disbursed loans with MTD and MoM trends).
3) Total Amount Received (loan repayments with MTD and MoM changes).
4) Average Interest Rate and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio.

# Good vs. Bad Loan KPIs:

1) Percentage, applications, funded amounts, and received amounts for both good and bad loans.

# Loan Status Grid View:

Insights into metrics such as:
1) Total Loan Applications
2) Funded Amount
3) Amount Received
4) Average Interest Rate
5) Debt-to-Income Ratio
6) Month-to-Date metrics for funded amount and amount received.
   
# Dashboard 2: Overview

# Charts:

1) Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Analyze seasonality in loan applications.
2) Regional Analysis by State (Map): Identify areas with significant loan activity.
3) Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understand distribution by term lengths (36 vs. 60 months).
4) Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Examine how employment history affects loan metrics.
5) Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Visualize the reasons borrowers seek loans.
6) Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Explore the relationship between home ownership and loan metrics.
   
# Dashboard 3: Details

Comprehensive grid view providing:
1) Borrower information
2) Loan purpose
3) Homeownership status
4) Loan grades and sub-grades
5) Funded amount, interest rate, installment amount, and total received.
   
# Tools and Technologies
1) SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
2) Power BI: For creating dashboards with rich visualizations.
3)Excel: Used for initial data exploration and preparation.

# Data Source

The dataset contains information on:
1) Loan applications
2) Borrower demographics
3) Loan statuses
4) Financial performance metrics (funded amount, interest rates, etc.).

# Installation and Usage

1) SQL Scripts:
   a) Import the dataset into your database.
   b) Use the provided SQL queries to extract and transform data.
   
2) Power BI Dashboards:
   a) Import the processed data into Power BI.
   b) Open the provided .pbix file to access the dashboards.

# Future Enhancements
1) Adding predictive analytics for loan default probabilities.
2) Expanding the dataset to include more borrower features for deeper analysis.
3) Integrating real-time data updates in dashboards.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL and Power BI in performing data analysis and visualization. It serves as a robust tool for understanding and improving loan performance metrics in a banking context.
